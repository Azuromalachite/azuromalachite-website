About Me
======
Originally from Thailand, I am a Master's student at the Graduate School of Engineering Biology at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), working under the supervision of Professor Sung Sun Yim. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Bio and Brain Engineering, with a minor in Biological Science, also from KAIST.

My scientific journey began at Kamnoetvidya Science Academy (KVIS) in Wang Chan Valley, Rayong, adjacent to the Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology (VISTEC). After graduating, I interned at VISTEC, where I explored alternative enzymes for CRISPR diagnostics and conducted metagenomic mining for novel PET-degrading enzymes. In 2024, I returned to VISTEC as a research assistant under Dr. Chayasith Uttamapinant, developing an image processing and analysis pipeline for protein condensates involved in DNA amplification.

Outside the lab, I enjoy photographing nature—especially flowers, bees, and birds—and exploring Korean dramas and music. I am also embarking on a personal project to study the taxonomy of blue-banded bees (*Amegilla*) in Thailand, a challenging and fascinating group of bees to identify.
